# Sectionation v0.2

## About

Sectionation is a small jQuery plugin that allows a single page to be sectioned up, linking those sections to navigation. The navigation will auto-highlight based on which section the user has scrolled to, and clicking the navigation will animate scrolling to the top of that specific section.

## Usage

## Compatibility

* IE 7 & 8
* FF 3.6
